## ✨ **Cooking Tips**
- **For Better Pasta:** Always cook pasta al dente and save a cup of pasta water before draining to help your sauce stick better.
- **Perfect Pancakes:** Let your pancake batter rest for 10 minutes before cooking for fluffier pancakes.
- **For a Crusty Baguette:** When baking, place a pan of water at the bottom of the oven to create steam for a crispier crust.

## 📌 **Detailed Notes**

### 🔑 **Key Concepts**
1. **Newton's First Law:**  
   - *Definition:* An object will remain at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.  
   - *Key Insight:* Also called the *law of inertia*.  
   - Example: A book on a table stays still until you push it.

2. **Newton's Second Law:**  
   - *Definition:* Force = Mass × Acceleration (F = ma).  
   - *Key Insight:* Force is directly proportional to acceleration.  
   - Example: Pushing a lighter object accelerates it more than a heavier one.

3. **Newton's Third Law:**  
   - *Definition:* For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  
   - Example: When you jump, the ground pushes you upward.

### 📖 **Examples**

#### Example 1: Applying Newton's Laws
- **Scenario:** A car accelerating on a flat road.  
  - *First Law:* The car remains stationary until you press the accelerator.  
  - *Second Law:* The harder you press the accelerator, the greater the car's acceleration.  
  - *Third Law:* The car's tires push backward on the road, and the road pushes the car forward.

#### Example 2: Real-World Application
- **Rocket Launch:** The expulsion of gas pushes the rocket upward (Third Law).
